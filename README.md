# **FARM DEFENDER**
This game is a project I developed as part of the "Unity Learn Junior Programmer" program. It was created with the aim of improving my skills. Additional features have been added to the project: a game over scene, and animals can only disappear if they are fed with the correct food (cow=apple, dog=bone, and horse=carrot), otherwise the player will die.

## **How To Play**
Basic Features
 * Limited Player Movement: The player can move within certain boundaries in the right, left, up, and down directions.
 * Animals: Animals are spawned at intervals and move forward.
 * Game Over: If animals pass the player and the player loses all 3 lives, it results in a game over.

Additional Features
The project includes the following additional features:
 * Life System: A life system with 3 lives has been added.
 * Food: Each animal can only be fed with a specific type of food.
 * Difficulty Level: The player must avoid hitting the animals, prevent them from passing beyond the boundary, and find the correct keys on the keyboard.


## **Unity Version**
2021.3.30f1 LTS

## **Note**
This project was originally developed in 2024. It appears at the top of my GitHub profile because I have recently transferred and reorganized my older projects into my new GitHub account.
